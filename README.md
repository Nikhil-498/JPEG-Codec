# JPEG-Codec

I implmented jpeg compression algorithm with good compression ratio as well as good PSNR value.
Using this algorithm we can compress any 2D photo to any extent with reasonable PSNR value

By applying above algorithm compression ratio factor ‘2’ for face and ‘12’ for rest of the image and we able to achieve compression rate 63.81 with PSNR value 31.04.
